## User Experience (UX)
---

- ### User Stories

    - #### First Time Visitor Goals
        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the purpose of the site, see basic instructions on how to play the quiz and be able to start playing the quiz to challenge myself on my knowledge of my favourite MARVEL movies. 
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate through the site in an organic manner, see previous High Scores and challenge myself to get a good score. 
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be visually impressed with a MARVEL themed colour scheme and authentic font styling that’s in keeping with the MARVEL franchise and sets the mood for an avid MARVEL fan.

    - #### Returning Visitor Goals
        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to check High Scores and see if any of my friends have beaten my score. 
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I also want to be able to take the quiz again to try and beat my previous score.

        2. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to continue to navigate the site with ease and see a consistent page layout that I remain familiar with. 


- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme
    - ##### A blend of MARVEL themed colouring to include strong bold colours in keeping with the MARVEL franchise. This will help set the mood for the ultimate MARVEL fan. 

  - #### Typography
    - ##### The MARVEL theme is continued with use of a comic book style font from Google Fonts named ‘Bangers’ and gives the site a MARVEL themed look and feel. 

  - #### Imagery
    - ##### To coincide with the colour scheme and overall MARVEL themed site, some pictures of MARVEL characters have been utilised to keep the theme.

- ### UX Design Planes
    - #### Strategy
        - ##### My aim of the design is to make this a simple, ease of use website for individuals wishing to test their knowledge on their favourite MARVEL movies and compete against their friends to obtain the highest score.

    - #### Scope
        - ##### I want to provide users with a brief overview of the instructions for the quiz and provide an easy navigation experience throughout the quiz.

    - #### Structure 
        - ##### I want the site to be intuitive, consistent, and easy to navigate. I aim to keep the pages basic and easy to use. Given the bold colour scheme in keeping with the MARVEL theme I aim to keep the question page minimalistic so to be easy on the eye and not make the user feel weighed down or distracted with too much detail.

    - #### Skeleton 
        - ##### Wireframes - [View](https://github.com/smithylee81/__________) Note basic drawings have been produced rather than on the Balsamiq website due to time constraints, this will be added should time allow. 

    - #### Surface
        - ##### The colour scheme together with the imagery described was used to create an overall eye-catching MARVEL themed experience.
