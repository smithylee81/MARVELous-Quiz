- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme
    - ##### A blend of MARVEL themed colouring to include strong bold colours in keeping with the MARVEL franchise. This will help set the mood for the ultimate MARVEL fan. 

  - #### Typography
    - ##### The MARVEL theme is continued with use of a comic book style font from Google Fonts named ‘Bangers’ and gives the site a MARVEL themed look and feel. 

  - #### Imagery
    - ##### To coincide with the colour scheme and overall MARVEL themed site, some pictures of MARVEL characters have been utilised to keep the theme.

- ### UX Design Planes
    - #### Strategy
        - ##### My aim of the design is to make this a simple, ease of use website for individuals wishing to test their knowledge on their favourite MARVEL movies and compete against their friends to obtain the highest score.

    - #### Scope
        - ##### I want to provide the users with a brief overview of the instructions for the quiz and provide an easy navigation experience throughout the quiz.

    - #### Structure
        - ##### I want the site to be intuitive, consistent, and easy to navigate. I aim to keep the pages basic and easy to use with a bold colour scheme in keeping with the MARVEL theme. I aim to keep the pages similar throughout for ease of use and include MARVEL images to keep the theme.

    - #### Skeleton
        - ##### Wireframes - [View](https://github.com/smithylee81/MARVELous-Quiz/blob/3397d173bde5189ecc6d41a079ff762cc4336707/Wireframes) Basic drawings have been produced rather than on the Balsamiq website keeping things simplistic.

    - #### Surface
        - ##### The colour scheme together with the imagery described was used to create an overall eye-catching MARVEL themed experience with a Comic book feel.

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- ### First Time Visitor Goals

    - #### As a first-time visitor,I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site, easily navigate to the instructions, and take the quiz.
        1. Upon entering the site, users are greeted with an easily readable and clean title and navigation bar to allow access to the page of their choice. Below this there is an image of the MARVEL logo, so the purpose of the site is clear.
        2. The user has options to hover over and click the page links to each section. The hover effect works well assisting the user in seeing which section they are selecting.
        3. As a first-time visitor, the user can select the High Scores page and see scores from previous players.
        4. At the bottom of the page, the footer, the user has options to select Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn and Discord to find out more about the Developer. These links open in a new tab for ease of use and navigating in their browser without losing the original page/site.


- ### Returning Visitor Goals

    - #### As a returning visitor,I want to check if there are anything new on the page, check the High Scores page to see if any of my friends have beaten my score and take the Quiz again if wished.
        1. Upon re-entering the site the user has familiarity given the sites consistency and its ease of use helps them navigate to the desired sections.
        2. The user can assess whether anything has changed since their last viewing of the site and check the high scores page to see if anyone has beaten their score.
        3. The user can navigate between the pages using the Nav Bar at the top of each page and also select the social media icons on each page via the footer if they wish to view the Developers’ platforms.

- ### Frequent User Goals
    - #### As a frequent visitor,I want to be able to see any new changes and challenge myself on my Marvel knowledge.
        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily navigate between the pages.

## Further Testing

- ### Manual Testing of each section
- #### Home Page/Navigation Bar: All page links were tested to ensure they take the user to the desired area on the page, the dropdown menu was also tested on smaller devices to ensure the user still had these options on their mobile/smaller device.

- Testing the navigation bar to ensure this takes the user to the different areas of the site:
    
    - #### Home Page,    :

### Testing Site Responsiveness
- #### Testing responsiveness was carried out using Dev.Tools on a variety of screen sizes as demonstrated below:
    - ##### Home Page - Moto G4
    ![Moto G4](assets/images/MarvelHomeMotoG4.png "MarvelHomeMotoG4")
    - ##### Home Page - Pixel 2
    ![Pixel 2](assets/images/MarvelHomePixel2.png "MarvelHomePixel2")
    - ##### Home Page - iPhone 5/SE
    ![iPhone 5/SE](assets/images/MarvelHomeiPhone5-SE.png "MarvelHomeiPhone5-SE")
    - ##### Home Page - iPhone 6/7/8
    ![iPhone 6/7/8](assets/images/MarvelHomeiPhone678.png "MarvelHomeiPhone678")
    - ##### Home Page - iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
    ![iPhone 6/7/8 Plus](assets/images/MarvelHomeiPhone678P.png "MarvelHomeiPhone678P")
    - ##### Home Page - iPad
    ![iPad](assets/images/MarvelHomeiPad.png "MarvelHomeiPad")
    - ##### Home Page - Surface Duo
    ![Surface Duo](assets/images/MarvelHomeSurfaceDuo.png "MarvelHomeSurfaceDuo")
    - ##### Home Page - Nest Hub Max
    ![Nest Hub Max](assets/images/MarvelHomeNestHubMax.png "MarvelHomeNestHubMax")

### Known/Solved Bugs
- #### Hero Image (Marvel Logo) on Home Page not responsive with a breakpoint at 770px, anything below this point the window covers the image:
![Hero Image Break](assets/images/MarvelLogoBreakBelow770px.png "MarvelLogoBreakBelow770px")

This was overcome by adding further css properties with a margin: auto; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; as per the final Home Page display. 



- #### The Instructions area also had a breakpoint on larger screens where it would display to the left of the screen above 922px and on smaller screens the content would spill over into other screen areas on screens below 374px:
![Instructions Breakpoint](assets/images/InstructBreakAbove922px.png "InstructBreakAbove922px")
![Instructions Breakpoint](assets/images/InstructBreakBelow374px.png "InstructBreakBelow374px")

This was overcome by adding further css properties with a margin: auto; and removing the height: 10em; property as per the final Home Page display.

- #### The Quiz page Marvel Images had were larger on large screens with a margin to the right showing empty space, on smaller screens these would display to the left and where considerably smaller:
![Marvel Images Desktop Break Breakpoint](assets/images/MarvelImgDisplayBugDeskT.png "MarvelImgDisplayBugDeskT")
![Marvel Images Desktop Break Breakpoint](assets/images/MarvelImgDisplayBugiPad.png "IMarvelImgDisplayBugiPad")

This was overcome by adding further css properties with a display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; and a margin left and right of 0.5rem, as per the final Quiz Page display.

- #### The initial JavaScript code wouldn't display any questions or choices.After running the quiz.js file through 'JS Hint', this showed that there were some warnings (mainly in connection with ES6 version), missing semicolons and there were some 'undefined variables':

- ##### 'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).
- ##### 'let' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).
- ##### 'arrow function syntax (=>)' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6').
- ##### 'spread operator' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6').
- ##### 'template literal syntax' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6').
- ##### ['number'] is better written in dot notation.

- ##### JSHINT Undefined Variables: startGame, getNewQuestion and incrementScore.

![JS Missing Semicolons](assets/images/JSmissingSemicolons.png "JSmissingSemicolons")

![JS Undefined Variables](assets/images/JSUndefinedVariables.png "JSUndefinedVariables")

This was overcome by adding 'const' to the undefined properties highlighted and adding the semicolons. 

- #### Once the variables had been defined the quiz page displayed the questions and answers/choices but would not display the 1st choice answer displaying 'undefined'. On review of the quiz.html file to assess any issues it was noted I'd mistyped writing 'number' instead of 'data-number':

![Quiz HTML Typo](assets/images/JScript1stChoiceBug.png "JScript1stChoiceBug")

![Quiz HTML Typo](assets/images/JScriptChoiceUndefinedBugHTML.png "JScriptChoiceUndefinedBugHTML")

This was overcome by adding 'data-' to number in the html.

## Project Barriers & Solutions

- ### Within the JavaScript there was an issue with the questions and answers displaying, in addition to the above solutions outlined within the 'Known/Solved Bugs' section, some of the JavaScript code required changing, specifically the following:

"const choices = Array.from(document.querySelector('.choice-text'));" changed to "const choices = document.querySelectorAll('.choice-text');"

Applied the prefix over postfix in "questionCounter++",changed to "++questionCounter". 

- ### Once all JavaScript was addressed there remained an issue with the Question and Choices display where on a mobile these would not display:

![Quiz Page Display Issue](assets/images/QuizQ&ANoDisplaySmall.png "QuizQ&ANoDisplaySmall")

This was overcome by changing the section div from 'container-fluid' to 'container'.

---
