- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme
    - ##### A blend of MARVEL themed colouring to include strong bold colours in keeping with the MARVEL franchise. This will help set the mood for the ultimate MARVEL fan. 

  - #### Typography
    - ##### The MARVEL theme is continued with use of a comic book style font from Google Fonts named ‘Bangers’ and gives the site a MARVEL themed look and feel. 

  - #### Imagery
    - ##### To coincide with the colour scheme and overall MARVEL themed site, some pictures of MARVEL characters have been utilised to keep the theme.

- ### UX Design Planes
    - #### Strategy
        - ##### My aim of the design is to make this a simple, ease of use website for individuals wishing to test their knowledge on their favourite MARVEL movies and compete against their friends to obtain the highest score.

    - #### Scope
        - ##### I want to provide the users with a brief overview of the instructions for the quiz and provide an easy navigation experience throughout the quiz.

    - #### Structure 
        - ##### I want the site to be intuitive, consistent, and easy to navigate. I aim to keep the pages basic and easy to use with a bold colour scheme in keeping with the MARVEL theme. I aim to keep the pages similar throughout for ease of use and include MARVEL images to keep the theme.

    - #### Skeleton 
        - ##### Wireframes - [View](/github.com/smithylee81/MARVELous-Quiz/blob/3397d173bde5189ecc6d41a079ff762cc4336707/Wireframes) Basic drawings have been produced rather than on the Balsamiq website keeping things simplistic.

    - #### Surface
